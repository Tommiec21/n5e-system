# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Fixed
- Releases are published as the latest release (not a GitHub pre-release), so Foundry's update link
  `releases/latest/download/system.json` resolves.

### Added
- Gear added to a character equips itself (weapons; armor if none is equipped; containers if none of
  that type is equipped). Equip toggle on the placeholder sheet's item list.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — Phase 1: data layer

### Added
- New standalone v13 system (id `n5e`) replacing the V3.1 (0.6.x) code base.
- Data models for 2 actor types, 13 item types, 6 effect types (TypeDataModel).
- `CONFIG.N5E` registries from the rules knowledge base: abilities, skills (Crafting removed),
  toolkits, progression, ranks, disciplines, DC tables, damage types, conditions (23 core + clan-scoped),
  states, keywords, stimuli, components, nature releases, areas, upcast presets, weapon/armor
  properties, stances, amps, terrain, rests, feat categories, skill actions, optional rules.
- Derived-data pipeline in a fixed 10-step order (see `module/data/actor/creature.mjs`).
- Rules functions with tests: proficiency, Mastery caps, HP/CP (10 + die max + Con, then die max +
  Con per level), AC formulas, chakra cost order and half-base floor, condition rank penalties,
  four-tier degree of success, Chain state machine, concentration DC and upkeep.
- Migration framework (world setting + numbered migrations) and the V3.1 → 4.0 mapping; old data is
  converted in memory on load and saved after a GM confirms.
- Placeholder sheets (ApplicationV2) showing every derived number and stored field.
- Tooling: pack/unpack (fvtt-cli, one JSON per document), lint, tests, consistency check, release
  zip, local install, GitHub Actions release workflow for manifest auto-updates.

### Rulings applied (King, 2026-11-07)
- Condition penalties (Shaken, Demoralized, Dazzled, Exhaustion) are folded into displayed totals.
- Skill actions: Proficient action without proficiency −3; Mastery action without Mastery −5;
  penalties don't stack (`rules/skill-actions.mjs`).
- Sealed modifies the base cost (raises the half-base floor) and applies to Cost None jutsu.
- Several cost multipliers: the caster chooses one (the preview shows the best and flags the choice).
- Concentration upkeep is half the cost actually paid when casting.
- Four-tier saves: a total exactly equal to the DC is a Success.
- Crits double damage dice and the ability modifier only; other flat bonuses don't double.
- Exhaustion's −1 to all dice rolls applies once per roll.
- Heavy armor ignores Dex entirely.
- Wearing Heavyweight (X) armor without the Strength score makes you Encumbered.
- Migrating unlinked tokens and world compendiums: deferred as a nice-to-have.
- E-Rank counts as rank 0; half-base cost floor rounds down.
- Hijutsu Flexibility uses the higher ability by default; players may pick one on the clan item
  (world setting "Hijutsu Flexibility: player's pick").
- Multiplication/division effects never stack (speed: Encumbered + Slowed = half, not a quarter).
- The ASI Mastery rank goes to a skill or toolkit only.
- Jutsu Scrolls exist for Ninjutsu and Genjutsu only.
- Adding ranks to a condition resets its duration.
- Damage: interception first (the interceptor's defenses apply instead of the target's), then DR
  once per damage roll, then resistance and immunity.
- Stabilize is an Action; hostile-terrain indirect exposure is a Survival check (incl. Extreme Cold).
- Concentration: base 2, features raise it, no hard cap.
- "Sealing Kit" is the toolkit name; starting wealth is 500 Ryo or 5d6 × 30 (Ch5).
